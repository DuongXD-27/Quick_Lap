# Quick Lap (Laptop Recommendation System)

Team size: 5 people

- Project Field: Software Engineering, Object-Oriented Programming, Database, LLMs, Chatbot, Natural Language Processing, Data Scraping.

This project addresses that challenge by developing a question-answering and product recommendation system for e-commerce platforms.

To support efficient and accurate product discovery, we experimented with several approaches:
• From traditional keyword-based search and information processing to advanced AI methods such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using large language models (LLMs).

• By evaluating different LLMs and retrieval pipelines, we aim to identify the most effective combi-
nation for enhancing user experience and reducing search time.
